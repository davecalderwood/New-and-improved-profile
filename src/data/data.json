This will see if it runs super long if it will then run into future problems with wrapping if it goes longer than the card will allow. What happens if it runs off of the card? Will I set it to scroll or will it overlap with anything else on the page? This is almost long enough of a content on the card to test the length issue. I changed it to be a scroll auto so that way it will be able to scroll if the content is super long and needs more space than the card allows"
